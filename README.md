## Hello there! 👋

<>

My Name is Thomas and this is my Portfolio

Here you will find future, current and past projects of mine. (Important Projects are Pinned!)

I am currently using Unity and C# and am eager to branch out into more lanes of Game Development
I am also extremely interested in Level Design and the polishing of visuals within game development.

Most if not all current projects displayed on my Git are from my Circuit Stream Game Development Course,
where I am actively learning game development and also looking for career opportunities within the industry.

Enjoy, and thanks for stopping by!
